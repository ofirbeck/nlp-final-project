# NLP Final Project
An NLP project analyzing articles about NLP from Scopus, showing growing trends over the last 10 years. \
As part of step 13, I have conducted a bibliometric analysis based on the found results(available in both Word & PDF) 

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ofirbeck/nlp-final-project.git
   cd nlp-final-project
   ```

2. Install Dependencies(preferably on a virtual environment of Python):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook(final_project.ipynb)
